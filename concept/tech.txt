Fault tolerance
- is the resilient property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of failure or major dysfunction in one or more of its components.
- if its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure,
    as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can lead to total breakdown.


tight coupling - the components of a system are highly dependent on each other.
                If one component fails, it will also affect the others and eventually bring down the entire system.
